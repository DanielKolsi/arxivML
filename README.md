###An Alexa skill to read latest machine learning papers fromÂ arXiv
### Demo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HYyhwE2EvQ

Keep up to date with the latest machine learning, computer vision, and AI papers from arxiv.org.  ArxivML crawls the 50 most recent papers and abstracts posted under cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.NE, stat.ML.
Experience browsing papers in this exciting new way, no more missing out on interesting research. Start your morning with a fresh set of ideas and things to try. 
You can invoke the skill by asking Alexa to read the most recent papers from arxiv. Alexa will start by reading the title of the first paper and then asks you if you want to listen to the abstract, you can answer yes for the abstract, or answer no to go to the next paper. You can ask Alexa to stop anytime. Keep in mind, If you found out that the abstract Alexa is reading is not interesting, you can always ask Alexa to go to the next paper, by saying "Alexa, next".
